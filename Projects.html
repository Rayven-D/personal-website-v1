                            The cell simulation is a program that simulates a colony of cells 
                            growth and deaths. It compares each cell with their neighbors to determine
                            if the cell will die or be alive in the next step, doing 
                            this to every cell for 100 steps.<br><br>
                            This program makes use of multiprocessing to handle the arrays, and
                            it was tested with 10,000 x 10,000 array size, only taking less than
                            20 minutes with 36 processes.

                            This project modeled a health care system for making appointments, changing 
                            patient data, and looking at daily reports. We had to design the software using the specified requirements.

                            This program makes use of Object-Oriented Programming and using JSON files to store data.
                            We used Java to create the system, and JSON files as the "database" to store the data needed
                            needed.
